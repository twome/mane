# Mane

<small><i>Short for "do<b>main</b> patcher"</i></small>

##### Status: pre-alpha; not for public use

#### Security warnings:

- Treat your patches folder as if it were public: currently, any malicious website's JavaScript can request anything on the Mane server over `localhost`, and the Mane server doesn't yet discern who's asking, so it will respond freely. This will be fixed before leaving alpha.

---

Mane is a native menubar / system tray app and browser extension which automatically inserts modifications (JavaScript and CSS) into certain websites whenever you visit them. These "patches" are stored in a folder on your hard drive or a remote Git repository (WIP), so you can use patches made by other people and keep them in your cloud files with no fuss or accounts necessary. Hide sticky headers, add keyboard shortcuts to music players, improve hideous colour palettes, or cut out annoyances which adblockers miss because they aren't technically ads â€“ jury-rig any part of the web to your liking!

This is similar in approach to [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)/[TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo), and '[User Javascript & CSS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld)' on Chrome, but with an emphasis on a simple & nice user interface, and being able to edit and store patches in whatever way suits you (instead of weird custom editors and databases).

## Installation & usage

#### Server (to read and write patches as files)

**CLI**: Clone this repo, then, from the command line, `cd` into it, run `yarn install` to fetch dependencies, & then `yarn start-cli` to start the Node server on `localhost:1917` by default.

**macOS Electron app**: Run `yarn native` to launch the GUI app. It will briefly appear in the Dock, then move to the menubar/tray. No pre-packaged executables are ready yet, sorry!

#### Browser extension (to inject patches into webpages) 

Turn on 'developer/debug mode' in your browser's extension manager, then load this repo's `src/extension/` folder as an "unpacked extension" or similar.

[Properly packaged extension files & browser extension store links will come soon.]

## Usage

<i>**A note on terminology:** Here we refer to a "patch" to mean "a collection of JS and CSS files that are activated according to their list of URL matchers". "Matchers" are like [regular expressions](https://regexr.com/) which test against the browser's current URL. If any of a patch's matches match the current page's URL, the browser extension will inject all of its files into the page.</i>

You can quickly make a new patch that matches the current page's **domain** (eg. `google.com` - which matches `maps.google.com`, `www.google.com`, and `google.com/a-search-result`) by clicking 'New patch' in the Mane browser extension's popup. This will automatically create a new empty CSS and/or JS file in your Mane patches folder (by default, `~/.mane-patches`), and then immediately open them in your OS's default code editor.

You can disable a patch using the browser extension's popup (which will list any patches matching the current page), or by including a comment in the patch file(s) that looks like this [TODO]:

```javascript
/* mane-options active:false */
```

(The extension will automatically write this special comment into the top of the patch files.)

### Advanced URL matching

You don't need to use the extension to create a patch; it's only a convenience. You can simply make a new file in this repo's `patches/` directory (this default location can be [changed](#configuration) [TODO]). Name the file with the exact text of the matcher list you want to use, plus `.js` or `.css`.

Eg. for a patch that styles all artist subdomains on Bandcamp, but not the main Bandcamp page itself, you would create:

```
*.bandcamp.com.css
```

To just match *any* Bandcamp page, you would create:

```
bandcamp.com.css
```

If you wanted to apply a patch on any Bandcamp *or* Spotify page with the same JavaScript (eg. to automatically click the 'Play' button), you would create a **comma-separated list** of matchers:

```
bandcamp.com,spotify.com.js
```

(Don't worry: URLs can't include commas, so there's no potential for confusion.)

To add some CSS *and* some JavaScript that run on the same matcher (which would together form one patch), create one of each file with the **same filename, but different extensions**:

```
bandcamp.com.css
bandcamp.com.js
```

## Interaction with the filesystem

Normally, a filename for a patch will simply be the matchList concatenated into a comma-separated string. For very large matchlists, this could easily become very unwieldy.

It's a bit risky to create gigantic path names; lots of programs don't deal well with excessive sizes. Instead, we'll: 
	
- give this patch a sample of a few of the matches for human readability
- name the assets (JS & CSS) with that ID,
- put them in a folder named after that ID [TODO]
- insert the special comment `/* patch-urls <matches string goes here> */` at the top of each asset

When applying patches, we'll resolve each domain by:
	
- looking for a match in root asset (JS/CSS) filenames, then
- looking for a match in folder names (apply all files in folder) [TODO], then
- [TODO] looking for a match in folderName/matches.txt and applying all files in folder
- (optional & slow) looking for a custom comment in the first non-whitespace line of every asset: `/* patch-urls <matches string goes here> */`

The app should cache an index file of the locations of assets for all matchers from every patch's matchList, as looking through so many FS files will be very slow. It should also cache the contents of the assets in memory for repeated visits to pages with the same matchers.
